;===== Printing By Object G-code =======================
;===== Optimal settings for quality-focused printing ===
; This file is INTENTIONALLY EMPTY - this is CORRECT!
;
; "By Object" printing mode is NOT recommended for quality:
; - Prints one complete object before moving to next
; - Requires careful planning to avoid nozzle collisions
; - Limited part arrangement options
; - Not ideal for most quality-focused workflows
;
; RECOMMENDED: Use standard "By Layer" print sequence instead
; - Better for quality (consistent layer cooling)
; - More reliable (less collision risk)  
; - Easier to arrange parts on build plate
; - Works with all your filament types
;
; Leave this file EMPTY unless you specifically need by-object mode
