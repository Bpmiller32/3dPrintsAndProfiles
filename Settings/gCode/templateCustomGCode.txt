;===== Template Custom G-code =========================
;===== Optimal settings for quality-focused printing ===
; This file is INTENTIONALLY EMPTY - this is CORRECT!
;
; Use this file ONLY if you need custom G-code templates
; for specific advanced scenarios:
; - Custom material requirements not covered by main G-code
; - Experimental features or testing
; - Advanced printer modifications
;
; For NORMAL quality printing: Leave this EMPTY
; All your standard quality settings are handled by:
; - machineStartGCode.txt (with Z-offset fix)
; - machineEndGCode.txt (with reset)
; - pauseGCode.txt (preserves state)
; - layerChangeGCode.txt (tracks progress)
; - timelapseGCode.txt (captures frames)
; - changeFilamentGCode.txt (AMS changes)
;
; Your settings are NOW OPTIMIZED for quality!
; No custom templates needed for your use case.
